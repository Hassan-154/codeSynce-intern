- how the asynchronous related to promise:
  .Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword before a call to a function
   that returns a promise.This makes the code wait at that point until the promise is settled,
   at which point the fulfilled value of the promise is treated as a return value, or the rejected'
   value is thrown.
  .settimeout is asynchronousis function the timer function will not pause execution of other functions in the functions stack
- what is callback?
  .calling function inside another function is called a callback function:
  .pratcie the relationship between tow function using a callback function
- what is callback hell?
  .nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure.
- so the solution of callback is promise.
- a promise is a good way to handle asynchronous operations
  .what promise do?
   .its take instruction like this that do this, then do this, then do this, so its like a proper format in clean way.
   .first of all the promise will create, that I am gonna serve you icecream.
   .then it will go to pending stage.. . untill the customer order
   .reslove/reject
   .if resolve.then do this.then do this/ this also called promise channing
   .if reject.catch.(error) / the catch will only work when our promise will rejected
   .finally is the final reuslt that will work in bother reject or resolve.
