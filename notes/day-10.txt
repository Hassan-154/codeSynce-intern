- single thread
  .the execution of an entire task from beginning to end without interruption.
- asynchronous
  .fetch
   .callback
    def: A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
   .callback hell
    def: nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure.
   .promise
    def: success or rejection of function.
   .async/await
    .makes it easier to write promises.
    .async keyword use before function makes the function return promise.
    .await keyword make the program wait untill the promise is reolved.
- pass by value:
  .passing the value of the variable as an argument
- pass by refrecne: 
  .a method of passing the address of an argument 
  .arrays objects are non permitve
- hoisting
  .default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
- Shallow Copy vs Deep copy
  .shoallow copy
   .means that only the value will be copy not the location
   .we can use the shallow copy method in 2 way
   .by object assign method Object.assign( {}, objName )
   .by spread method {...objName}
  .deep copy
   .all levels of the object will be copied, this is true copy.
   .let copyNameObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(nameObj))  / 
   .first change the ojject into json format
   .and than convert back into new object
   .this method used to make sure that only the copy of the object will change.   
   .if we we declare function in the object that will no be resolved.
- what is lodash? 
  -to show function
- next day question?
  delete object property?
